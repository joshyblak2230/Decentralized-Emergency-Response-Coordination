# Decentralized Emergency Response Coordination

This repository contains a suite of smart contracts designed to revolutionize emergency response coordination through blockchain technology. These contracts create a transparent, resilient system for validating response agencies, tracking resource availability, managing incidents, coordinating deployments, and capturing lessons learned.

## Core Components

### Agency Verification Contract
Validates the legitimacy and jurisdiction of emergency response organizations to ensure that only authorized entities can participate in the network. This contract maintains a decentralized registry of verified agencies with their capabilities, jurisdictions, and authorization levels.

### Resource Inventory Contract
Records detailed information about available emergency assets including equipment, vehicles, supplies, and personnel. This contract enables real-time visibility of resource availability across organizations with automatic updates as statuses change.

### Incident Management Contract
Tracks all aspects of active emergency situations including location data, severity assessments, required resources, and evolving conditions. This contract serves as the single source of truth during crisis events, ensuring all stakeholders work from consistent information.

### Deployment Tracking Contract
Manages the assignment and movement of resources to emergency incidents, creating an immutable record of which assets were deployed, when, and by whom. This contract enables efficient coordination across organizational boundaries during complex responses.

### After-Action Contract
Records comprehensive assessments of response effectiveness, challenges encountered, and lessons learned. This contract preserves institutional knowledge and facilitates continuous improvement in emergency preparedness and response capabilities.
